# Senior-Project-DroneAR
The goal of this project was to learn some of the basic concepts of augmented reality technology because I think that it is going to have a huge impact on the world in many industries like game or education. I wanted to build a small app for iOS devices and learn necessary tools to build the app. 
The app would let users to generate an augmented reality object, and users can see it via thier device's camera. Moreover, the users can use a real physical object which I call the key to control the augmented reality object.


## How Does It Work?
When users open the app, the camera will be automatically opened, it tries to look for the real object or key. Users can render the augnemnted reality object by tapping anywhere on the screen and they will see a helicopter on their screen. Users need to point the camera to the key so the app can detect it; the system will lock the key and track it wherever it goes. Once the system can be able to track they key or the real physical object, the augmented reality object will just follow the key and go to wherever the key is at. 


## Difficulites and Problems
My first difficulty was learning Unity and explore its library to find the ones that can help to accomplish this project. I had to learn how to render an augmented reality object and how to make the system detect my key. I took quite a while to do research and figure it out. 

My sencond difficulty was that I have to learn C language because the scripts are written in C. However, it was not really hard and I was able to learn it in a short period of time because it is kind of similar to other languages that I know. 

The other problem that I encountered while running the demo was due to uncontroled conditions such as lighting or bad cameras. Sometimes, it was too dark and it did not have enough light so the camera could not detect the physical object. And devices with the bad camera also have a negative impact on running this app.
